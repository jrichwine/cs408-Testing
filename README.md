##Problem statement:
As the enrollment at Purdue continues to increase, it is becoming harder to find a
noncrowded
place to meet with your group, study for classes, or a dining court that isn't
packed. Existing programs only cover labs or other subsets of buildingsÍ¾ ours will encompass
multiple categories of buildings. Our program, the BoilerCheck Android app, will allow users to
checkin
and report conditions at popular buildings around campus. Users will also be able to
view current statistics of the building before making a decision on where to go.
